	Basic Authentication
	Token-Based Authentication (JWT)
	OAuth2

Basic Authentication:-
    Simple Method where user provides a username and password with each request.
    Credential are typically sent in the Authorization header encoded in Base64
Advantages:-
    -Easy to implement
    -Requires minimal configuration to set up
    -No session management, its stateless, each request contain the credentials, eliminating the need for the session
     management on the server
    Works Well for the small applications, internal services or API is with the limited user base and security req.

Limitations- credentials are easily decoded, so it`s important to use https with API.
To implement adding the roles and initially add dependency of security to the pom.
